Here’s a small and clear explanation of Use Case Diagram, Class Diagram, and Sequence Diagram – perfect for writing in exams or project reports.


---
1. Use Case Diagram
➤ What it is?
A Use Case Diagram shows the functional requirements of a system and how different actors (users) interact with it.
➤ Key Points
Represents what the system does, not how.
Actors are external entities (users, systems).
Use cases are system functions.
Helps understand the overall system behavior.
➤ Example (Hospital Management System)
Actors: Patient, Doctor, Receptionist, Admin
Use Cases: Register Patient, Schedule Appointment, Record Consultation, Generate Bill…

2. Class Diagram
➤ What it is?
A Class Diagram represents the static structure of a system.
It shows classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships.
➤ Key Points
Used in object-oriented design.
Shows how data is organized.
Displays inheritance, association, aggregation, composition.
Helps in database and code structure planning.
➤ Example
Classes: Patient, Doctor, Appointment, Prescription, Invoice
Relationships:
One patient can have many appointments.
One doctor can write many prescriptions.

3. Sequence Diagram
➤ What it is?
A Sequence Diagram shows the interaction between objects over time for a specific functionality.
➤ Key Points
Represents flow of messages between objects.
Time moves from top to bottom.
Helps in understanding how a feature works step-by-step.
Useful for system process flow.
➤ Example (Appointment Booking)
Receptionist → System → Database → Confirm appointment.

🆚 Quick Difference
Diagram Type	Focuses On	Static or Dynamic	Used For
Use Case	User interactions	Static	Requirements
Class	Structure (classes)	Static	System design
Sequence	Message flow	Dynamic	Process logic

🎯 In One Line Each (for exam):
Use Case Diagram – Shows what the system does and how users interact with it.
Class Diagram – Defines the object structure of the system using classes and relationships.
Sequence Diagram – Describes how objects interact through messages to perform a task over time
